    "\n",
    "Imagine that you are employed by the Montana State Gaming Board, and you have received an anonymous tip suggesting that the dealer in the dice games that frequently occur at the Oxford is cheating.  In particular, the dealer is surreptitiously switching from a fair die to a loaded one (and back) with a certain probability.  In this game, the ante is a doller.  you choose a number, the dealer rolls the die, and if it matches you get back 3 times your ante.  Otherwise, you lose your ante.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You examine security camera footage from which you extracted the following dataset, with *states* describing whether the die was loaded, and rolls being the outcome of each die roll."

Play 1000 games of dice with the dealer, using the forward algorithm to determine when the dealer is cheating.  Recall that you now don't have access to the dealer's state, only the rolls!

Consider the case where instead of tracking the plane with a GPS, we are tracking it with a radar, where the radar provides an estimate of range ($\\rho_t$) and angle ($\\theta_t$).  Assuming that the radar is located at $(x=0,y=0)$, the process of taking an observation then is:\n",
